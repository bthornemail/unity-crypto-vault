"Create a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that systematically organizes a set of provided keywords by categorizing them based on their inherent functions and relationships within a decentralized marketplace and social network. The process should start by identifying overarching categories that represent fundamental concepts. Then, detail how each keyword fits into these categories, illustrating the progression from broader themes to more specific instances or related ideas.

**Step 1: Categorization** - Begin by reviewing the list of keywords and refine these into two distinct lists:
- A list of fundamental concepts: These are broad categories that encapsulate overarching themes or functions.
- A list of specific instances or related concepts: These words represent the application or manifestation of the fundamental concepts in various contexts.

**Step 2: Create the DAG** - Using the categorized lists, construct a Directed Acyclic Graph that visually represents the hierarchy and relationships between the fundamental concepts and their specific instances or related concepts. The DAG should:
- Start with nodes representing fundamental concepts at the top.
- Progressively branch out to nodes representing more specific instances or related concepts, showing how each idea leads into another.
- Ensure clarity and conciseness in the representation, aiming for a coherent hierarchy that showcases the progression from broader to more specific categories.

**Step 3: Visualization** - Choose a format for the DAG that aids in understanding the relationships and hierarchy among the concepts. This could be in the form of mermaid entity relationship diagrams or a mind map, depending on which better suits the complexity and nature of the relationships.

**Objective**: The goal is to provide a clear and concise visualization that showcases the systematic categorization of keywords, from fundamental concepts to their specific instances or related ideas, facilitating a deeper understanding of how these concepts are interconnected.
