## [Embedded workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers#embedded_workers)

There is not an "official" way to embed the code of a worker within a web page, like [`<script>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script) elements do for normal scripts. But a [`<script>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script) element that does not have a `src` attribute and has a `type` attribute that does not identify an executable MIME type can be considered a data block element that JavaScript could use. "Data blocks" is a more general feature of HTML that can carry almost any textual data. So, a worker could be embedded in this way:

HTMLCopy to Clipboard

```
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>MDN Example - Embedded worker</title>
    <script type="text/js-worker">
      // This script WON'T be parsed by JS engines because its MIME type is text/js-worker.
      const myVar = 'Hello World!';
      // Rest of your worker code goes here.
    </script>
    <script>
      // This script WILL be parsed by JS engines because its MIME type is text/javascript.
      function pageLog(sMsg) {
        // Use a fragment: browser will only render/reflow once.
        const frag = document.createDocumentFragment();
        frag.appendChild(document.createTextNode(sMsg));
        frag.appendChild(document.createElement("br"));
        document.querySelector("#logDisplay").appendChild(frag);
      }
    </script>
    <script type="text/js-worker">
      // This script WON'T be parsed by JS engines because its MIME type is text/js-worker.
      onmessage = (event) => {
        postMessage(myVar);
      };
      // Rest of your worker code goes here.
    </script>
    <script>
      // This script WILL be parsed by JS engines because its MIME type is text/javascript.

      // In the past blob builder existed, but now we use Blob
      const blob = new Blob(
        Array.prototype.map.call(
          document.querySelectorAll("script[type='text\/js-worker']"),
          (script) => script.textContent,
        ),
        { type: "text/javascript" },
      );

      // Creating a new document.worker property containing all our "text/js-worker" scripts.
      document.worker = new Worker(window.URL.createObjectURL(blob));

      document.worker.onmessage = (event) => {
        pageLog(`Received: ${event.data}`);
      };

      // Start the worker.
      window.onload = () => {
        document.worker.postMessage("");
      };
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="logDisplay"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

The embedded worker is now nested into a new custom `document.worker` property.

It is also worth noting that you can also convert a function into a Blob, then generate an object URL from that blob. For example:

JSCopy to Clipboard

```
function fn2workerURL(fn) {
  const blob = new Blob([`(${fn.toString()})()`], { type: "text/javascript" });
  return URL.createObjectURL(blob);
}
```
